# What is REST?

REST stands for Representational State Transfer. REST is a web standards based protocol and uses HTTP Protocol for 
Data communicaiton. It revolves around resources where every componenet is a resource and a resource is accessed by 
a common interface using HTTP standard methods. 



In REST architecture, a REST Server simply provides access to resources and the REST client accesses and presents the resources. Here each resource is identified by URIs/ Global IDs. REST uses various representations to represent a resource like Text, JSON and XML. JSON is now the most popular format being used in Web Services.
